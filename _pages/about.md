<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year Ph.D. student majoring in Data Science at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), supervised by [Chao Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/chaoh). 

My research interest includes Graph Neural Networks, Large Language Models and deep learning applications.


# 🔥 News
- *2023.10*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 We release our **Graph Large Language Models** - **GraphGPT** with pre-print paper, source code, model and data. Let's step to **Graph Learning in the era of LLM**!
- *2023.08*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 Two full papers about spatio-temporal data mining are accepted by **CIKM'23**. Thanks for all my co-authors and my supervisor!
- *2023.06*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 I graduated from SWJTU. Nice memories with all my friends, teachers and family!
- *2022.11*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 I am honored with *Cao Jianyou Student Award* **2022** (Selected from eight universities, including Southwest Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Central South University, etc. ).
- *2022.11*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 I am nominated for *National Scholarship for Encouragement* and *Provincial Outstanding Graduates*.
